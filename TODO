Django Multiple Database TODO List
==================================

Required for v1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Modify the admin interface to support multiple databases (doh).
    - Document how it is done
    - Modify m2m widgets to stick to the same database as parent
    - Modify inlines to stick to same database as parent

Optional for v1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are the next layer of UI. We can deliver for v1.2 without these if neccessary.

 * Technique for determining using() at runtime (by callback?)
 * Sticky models
   * Related objects
   * saving and deleting
   * default or an option
 * Sample docs for how to do:
   * master/slave
   * Sharding
 * Test protection against cross-database joins.
