Django Multiple Database TODO List
==================================

Required for v1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Finalize the sql.Query internals
   * Clean up the use of db.backend.query_class()
   * Verify it still works with GeoDjango
 * Resolve the public facing UI issues around using multi-db
   * Should we take the opportunity to modify DB backends to use fully qualified paths?
   * Should we clean up DATABASES['DATABASE_NAME'] to DATABASES['NAME'] etc?
 * Cleanup of new API entry points
    * validate() on a field
        * name/purpose clash with Honza?
        * any overlap with existing methods?

Optional for v1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are the next layer of UI. We can deliver for v1.2 without these if neccessary.

 * Technique for determining using() at runtime (by callback?)
 * Sticky models
   * Related objects
   * saving and deleting
   * default or an option
 * Sample docs for how to do:
   * master/slave
   * Sharding
 * Test protection against cross-database joins.
