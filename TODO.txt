TODO

The follow is a list, more or less in the order I intend to do them of things
that need to be done.  I'm trying to be as granular as possible.


1)  Replace old instances of :setting:`DATABASE_` with a new tag or something.

2)  Update all management commands in the following way:

    * ``dumpdata``: By default dump the ``default`` database.  Later add a
      ``--database`` flag.

    flush, reset, and syncdb need to not prompt the user multiple times.

3)  Handle nesting of Querysets using __in across multiple dbs.

4)  Handle backends with custom Query classes.

5)  Wait on the merge of the m2m stuff.

6)  Fix django.contrib.gis, it's broken in all sorts of ways.

7) Time permitting add support for a ``DatabaseManager``.
