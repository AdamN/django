TODO

The follow is a list, more or less in the order I intend to do them of things
that need to be done.  I'm trying to be as granular as possible.


1)  Replace old instances of :setting:`DATABASE_` with a new tag or something.

2)  Update all management commands in the following way:

    * ``dumpdata``: By default dump the ``default`` database.  Later add a
      ``--database`` flag.

    flush, reset, and syncdb need to not prompt the user multiple times.

3)  Remove any references to the global ``django.db.connection`` object in the
    SQL creation process.  This includes(but is probably not limited to):

    * The way we create ``Query`` from ``BaseQuery`` is awkward and hacky.
    * ``Field.get_db_prep_lookup``
    * ``DateField.get_db_prep_value``
    * ``DateTimeField.get_db_prep_value``
    * ``DecimalField.get_db_prep_save``
    * ``TimeField.get_db_prep_value``

4)  Wait on the merge of the m2m stuff.

5)  Add the ``using`` Meta option.  Tests and docs(these are to be assumed at
    each stage from here on out).

6) Time permitting add support for a ``DatabaseManager``.
